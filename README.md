# Finance-Recommendation-System
Welcome to the Finance Recommendation System! This project demonstrates how to build a recommendation engine for financial products like mutual funds, ETFs, bonds, and stocks. The system uses collaborative filtering techniques to suggest financial products based on user preferences and ratings.

Project Features

Simulated Dataset: A dataset containing user ratings for financial products.

User-Product Matrix: A pivot table representing users and their ratings for various financial products.

Cosine Similarity: Used to calculate the similarity between users based on their preferences.

Product Recommendations: Suggests products to users they have not yet rated, based on the preferences of similar users.

How It Works

Data Preparation:

A dataset is created with user ratings for financial products.

The data is transformed into a user-product matrix.

Compute Similarity:

Cosine similarity is used to measure the similarity between users.

Make Recommendations:

Products are recommended to users based on the ratings of similar users.

Tools and Technologies

Python: Core programming language.

Libraries:

NumPy for numerical computations.

Pandas for data manipulation.

Scikit-learn for computing cosine similarity.
